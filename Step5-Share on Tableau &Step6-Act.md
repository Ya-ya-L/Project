# Step 6: Act

## Tasks: 
Conduct top 3 recommendations to the Cyclistic marketing analytics team for increasing sales and transforming casual riders to members .

### 1. Increase bikes at popular stations
Based on the analysis, Streeter Dr & Grand Ave was the most popular start station for riders. Cyclistic could provide more bikes for riders and put an ad at the station to promote the annual membership program.

### 2. Increase electric bikes
Casual riders preferred electric bikes than any other bikes. Also, although members rided more classic bikes (1,709,743), they rided the similar amount of electric bikes (1,635,897). Investing in electric bikes may increase the casual riders and trigger them to buy annual memberships with our marketing campaigns.

### 3. Offer discounts on weekends and in the summer
Based on the time preference analysis, casual riders used our services mostly on weekends. We can offer exclusive weekend discounts for members in order to trigger casual riders to buy annual membership. Also, summer (June to August) was the most popular time for all riders. Investing in more ads during the summer time could increase brand awareness, and attract casual riders to but membership by offering summer discounts. We can also design a new membership that is only for three months so that casual riders who are not interested in annual membership can have another choice.
