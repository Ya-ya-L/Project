Deliverables

In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process:
**ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**.

*/


-- Ask

/*
 
 Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


Tasks:

 1. Identify the business task: The ultimate business goal is to increase the amount of casual riders.
    The business task is to analyze previous user data to understand the key preferences and differences between casual riders and members.
    Then, improve the future marketing strategies and programs based on the findings.
    
 2. Consider key stakeholders:
 ● Lily Moreno:
   The director of marketing and your manager. 
   Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
   These may include email, social media, and other channels.
 ● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: 
   A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
   You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you,
   as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
 ● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

*/


-- Prepare

/*

Tasks:

1. Download data and store it appropriately:
    I downloaded the data in CSV. for the whole year of 2022 to analyze the behavior of casual riders and members,
    and find insights for 2023 marketing strategy. 
    I uploaded the data to BigQuery.
    
    The database name: `practice-gda-377022`
    The dataset name: `cyclistic`
    Table names: 202201, 202202, 202203 ... 202212, a total of 12 tables.
    
2. Identify how it’s organized:
    The data is categorized by month, and the data structure is the same for each month.
    
3. Sort and filter the data: I imported the 12 CSV files in Excel and sorted them ascendingly to find if there was any NULL value.

4. Determine the credibility of the data: The data is creditable because it is from the company's database (according to the scenario.)

*/


-- Process

/*

Tasks:

1. Check the data for errors.

2. Choose your tools: I will use Excel and SQL(BigQuery) to clean data and then use SQL(BigQuery) to analyze.

3. Transform the data so you can work with it effectively.

4. Document the cleaning process:
